## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

-   View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
-   See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
-   Add/Remove products from the cart
-   Edit product quantities in the cart
-   Fill in all fields in the checkout
-   Receive form validations if fields are missed or incorrect during checkout
-   See correct checkout totals depending on the products in the cart
    -   Shipping always adds $50 to the order
    -   VAT is calculated as 20% of the product total, excluding shipping
-   See an order confirmation modal after checking out with an order summary
-   **Bonus**: Keep track of what's in the cart, even after refreshing the browser (`localStorage` could be used for this if you're not building out a full-stack app)
